            <p className='mt-10'>Apart from being a web developer, my number one hobby is 
            enjoying the outdoors, biking on the road and off the trail.  Indoors, I like to 
            cook (and eat) cuisines from all over the world and watch television series and 
            movies.  I spend most of my free time with my beautiful wife, Meri, who I met in my 
            previous residence of Tijuana, Mexico.  We both love to travel and are very proud
            of Latin American culture.  The Spanish language has also always been a topic of 
            interest for me that never gets old!</p>
