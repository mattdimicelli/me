            <p className='mt-10'>Apart from being a web developer, my number one hobby is biking.  I've got a little dog
                name Teddy LÃ³pez who gets me out of the house on foot every day.  Indoors, I like to
            cook (and eat) ethnic foods and watch television series and
            movies.  I've spent a lot of time working on an extensive genealogy project, and I am now using all of that
                research to apply for Italian citizenship. I spend most of my free time with my wife who I met when I
                lived in Mexico.</p>
